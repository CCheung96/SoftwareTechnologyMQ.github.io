# Practice with conditions

You should be able to solve the majority of questions at a specific level to achiever that level. For example, if you can solve majority of questions at "Pass to Credit" level but not "Credit to Distinction" level, it means you are somewhere in the Pass-Credit region.

## Level 1 - Pass

## Level 2 - Pass to Credit

## Level 3 - Credit to Distinction

## Level 4 - Distinction to High Distinction

## Level 5 - High Distinction and beyond
